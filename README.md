**THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

A Rust client for sending notifications to your own phone or desktop.

**[notify.run](https://notify.run) makes it easy to programmatically send notifications to your own phone or desktop.**

This repository contains a [**CLI Client**](https://github.com/gruvw/notify-run-rs-api/tree/main/notify-run-cli) as well a [**Rust API**](https://github.com/gruvw/notify-run-rs-api).

See the original Python Client and API: [notify-run/notify.run](https://github.com/notify-run/notify.run). The [notify.run Rust backend](https://github.com/notify-run/notify-run-rs) is also open-source and MIT licensed, but support for self-hosting is a low priority use case.

**Note**: PRs are welcome if you want add features or improve existing ones.
