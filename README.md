**THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

**[notify.run](https://notify.run) makes it easy to programmatically send notifications to your own phone or desktop.** It is provided as a free web service that can be used without installation (on both the sending and receiving end).

This repository contains a **CLI Client** as well as an easy to use **Rust API**.

See the original Python Client & API: https://github.com/notify-run/notify.run

The [notify.run Rust backend](https://github.com/notify-run/notify-run-rs) is open-source and MIT licensed, but support for self-hosting is a low priority use case.
